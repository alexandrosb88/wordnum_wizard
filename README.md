## Description

This is a Python application which processes a wordlist or individual words and appends numerical values in various formats at the end of the provided word/words.

The output is consisted of the below formats:

>Ordered numbers: nick1, nick2, nick3, nick99, nick100 etc.\
>Year: nick1998, nick1999, nick2000 etc.\
>Date: nick0101, nick0201, nick0301 etc.\
>Date + Year: nick01011998, 09081999 etc.\
>Symbol + Number: nick_7, nick_13, nick_21, nick-7, nick-13 etc.

The application can be used in cybersecurity projects given the fact that a word+number format(e.g. a name with a random number, a year or a date) is a commonly used password combination.



## Usage

If the wordlist option is chosen, the list should be imported in txt format and each word should be presented on a seperate line.
